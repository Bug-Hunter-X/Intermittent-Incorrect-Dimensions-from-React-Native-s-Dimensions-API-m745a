This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions, but the values returned are incorrect or inconsistent.  This can manifest as unexpected layout issues, components not rendering correctly, or images being displayed at the wrong size.  The problem is often intermittent and difficult to debug, because the `Dimensions` API usually works fine, making it a very uncommon error.
